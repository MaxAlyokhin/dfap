## Digital fixation of audio processes

Independent project with a nonbrand but exact name from Krasnodar, Russia, specializing in field recording and musique concr√®te. All sounds are captured by a digital recorder (which is attached to an extension pole) and composed into tracks.

## Project implementation

Own design layout is made in Figma. The site is a set of screens switched by JS using the navigation menu. The layout of all elements of the interface is written using Flexbox, and the main Sass-file with styles is written with a deep nesting, which gives a highly specific CSS after compilation. Separately, the mobile version of the site and the rearrangement of the navigation menu and text blocks with images is completed.
